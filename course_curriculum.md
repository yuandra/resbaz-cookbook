# Ideas for classes


As mentioned at LINK, a defining feature of a ResBaz conference is that the classes are taught by researchers as opposed to IT professionals. Here's some ideas/resources for running researcher-led classes:
* The global organisation that has led the way in researcher-led training is [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/). Their lessons on scientific computing (e.g. unix shell, Python, MATLAB, R, git/GitHub) are a perfect fit for a ResBaz conference. It's not unusual to run more than one Software Carpentry workshop simultaneously at a ResBaz conference.
* [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) is a sister organisation of Software Carpentry, which focuses on domain specific courses on topics such as spreadsheets, databases and programming with Python or R.
* Research Platform Services at the University of Melbourne have a range of open source lessons on topics including [Natural Language Toolkit](https://github.com/resbaz/nltk), [data visualisation with D3.js](https://github.com/IsaKiko/D3-visualising-data), [LaTeX document editing](https://github.com/cryptarch/latex-novice) and computer aided design tools like AutoDesk Inventor and 3DSlicer.
