# The Research Bazaar Cookbook

The aim of this Cookbook is to provide tips, tricks, advice & ingredients for starting a ResBaz Conference at your own institution. Like ResBaz, this Cookbook believes in open and collaborative communities. If you would like to contribute and become an author of this cookbook, please email [research.bazaar@gmail.com](research.bazaar@gmail.com).

The Cookbook will end with two additional recipes: ResBaz Campaign & ResBaz Community. These will provide extra suggestions for continuing ResBaz into the year.
