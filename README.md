# The Research Bazaar Cookbook

The aim of this Cookbook is to provide tips, tricks and advice for running a ResBaz Conference at your own institution. Like ResBaz, this Cookbook believes in open and collaborative communities. If you'd like to contribute and become an author of this cookbook, please email [research.bazaar@gmail.com](research.bazaar@gmail.com). Confused? Flick us an [email](research.bazaar@gmail.com) or tweet at [@ResBaz](www.twitter.com/resbaz).

Planning for ResBaz 2017 has already started! Dates have been set for January 31st - February 2 (3 days). Join the action on our collaborative Slack channel (ask for an invite via [email](research.bazaar@gmail.com)). We'll also be blogging our journey over on Wordpress - [see here for updates](resbaz.blog.wordpress.com). 

The Cookbook will end with two additional recipes: ResBaz Campaign & ResBaz Community. These will provide extra suggestions for continuing ResBaz into the year.

### Is my event eligible to be an official ResBaz Conference?


We've had a number of people ask whether an event they're running qualifies to call itself an official ResBaz Conference. In a nutshell, the defining feature of a ResBaz Conference is that it brings together classes on many different aspects of digital research, with the inclusion of social activities around those classes to encourage networking and knowledge/skill sharing among participants. For most of those classes the instructors have run the training several times before and have had that training quality assured by a third party (e.g. Software Carpentry ran a number of instructor training courses in the lead up to ResBaz Conferences in 2015 and 2016). There is typically a large number of helpers in the room to assist learners (e.g. 1 helper for every 5-10 learners) and most of the instructors/learners are themselves active researchers, as opposed to professional IT or library staff.

Of course, there are no hard and fast rules on this stuff. If you think you might like to run a ResBaz Conference, get in touch at [research.bazaar@gmail.com](research.bazaar@gmail.com) and we can figure out whether your event does qualify this time around, or whether a ResBaz Conference is something you can work towards in future. For example, you might run a single Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry workshop this time around, and then build up to a ResBaz Conference in future by adding a social program and additional classes.


### Which sites are currently hosting a ResBaz?

For a full list of sites, [click here](https://github.com/resbaz/cookbook/wiki/ResBaz-host-sites). If you'd like to "meet" other site leaders (the ResBazadors), join our open Slack channel - send a request via [research.bazaar@gmail.com](research.bazaar@gmail.com).


### What are the key steps for hosting a site? 

Here's a summary of the steps involved in being a host site for ResBaz 2017:

1. Sign up to the ResBaz newsletter to keep up-to-date with the latest news and information 
  * This simply involves emailing research.bazaar@gmail.com with the subject line: "add me to your list of ResBazadors!"

2. Add your site to the list of [[host sites|ResBaz host sites]]

3. Decide on the classes and social activities you'd like to run
  * For ideas check out the [[ideas for classes|Ideas for classes]] and [[ideas for social activities|Ideas for social activities]] pages
  * Many sites around the world are also creating progress pages on the wiki to share the details of their event with the wider community. The [[Brisbane page|Progress summary, ResBaz Brisbane]] is a good example of a small ResBaz event for first time organisers, while the [[Melbourne page|Progress summary, ResBaz UniMelb]] shows just how big you can go!

4. Advertise your event
  * The main [ResBaz website](https://feb2016.resbaz.com/) has a map with pins corresponding to each of the host sites. If you click on those pins they'll take you to the dedicated webpage for that site.
    * To create and launch your own site page, head to [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/resbaz/resbaz-2016-02-01) which hosts the source code for the website. The README has instructions for creating site pages.
  * Please use the #ResBaz hashtag whenever tweeting about your event
  * If you need a copy of the ResBaz logo for advertising purposes, you can find it (in many different file formats) at [this folder](https://github.com/resbaz/resbaz-2016-02-01/tree/gh-pages/img/resbaz_logos) of the GitHub repository 




If you have any questions about running your ResBaz event, the best place go is the ResBaz [Gitter channel](http://melbourne.resbaz.edu.au/post/113825220654/join-us-on-gitter). Alternatively, you can tweet us [@ResBaz](https://twitter.com/ResBaz) or email research.bazaar@gmail.com.
