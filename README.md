The aim of this Cookbook is to provide tips, tricks and advice for running a ResBaz conference at your own institution. Like ResBaz, this Cookbook believes in open and collaborative communities. If you'd like to contribute and become an author of this cookbook, please email [research.bazaar@gmail.com](research.bazaar@gmail.com). Confused? Flick us an [email](research.bazaar@gmail.com) or tweet at [@ResBaz](www.twitter.com/resbaz).

Planning for ResBaz 2017 has already started! Dates have been set for January 31st - February 2 (3 days). Join the action on our collaborative Slack channel (ask for an invite via [email](research.bazaar@gmail.com)). We'll also be blogging our journey over on Wordpress - [see here for updates](resbaz.blog.wordpress.com).

### ResBaz 2017

"ResBaz week" 


### Which sites are currently hosting a ResBaz?

For a full list of sites, [click here](https://github.com/resbaz/cookbook/wiki/ResBaz-host-sites). If you'd like to "meet" other site leaders (the ResBazadors), join our open Slack channel - send a request via [research.bazaar@gmail.com](research.bazaar@gmail.com).


### What are the key steps for hosting a site? 

Here's a summary of the steps involved in being a host site for ResBaz 2017:

1. Sign up to the ResBaz newsletter to keep up-to-date with the latest news and information 
  * This simply involves emailing research.bazaar@gmail.com with the subject line: "add me to your list of ResBazadors!"

2. Add your site to the list of [[host sites|ResBaz host sites]]

3. Decide on the classes and social activities you'd like to run
  * For ideas check out the [[ideas for classes|Ideas for classes]] and [[ideas for social activities|Ideas for social activities]] pages
  * Many sites around the world are also creating progress pages on the wiki to share the details of their event with the wider community. The [[Brisbane page|Progress summary, ResBaz Brisbane]] is a good example of a small ResBaz event for first time organisers, while the [[Melbourne page|Progress summary, ResBaz UniMelb]] shows just how big you can go!

4. Advertise your event
  * The main [ResBaz website](https://feb2016.resbaz.com/) has a map with pins corresponding to each of the host sites. If you click on those pins they'll take you to the dedicated webpage for that site.
    * To create and launch your own site page, head to [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/resbaz/resbaz-2016-02-01) which hosts the source code for the website. The README has instructions for creating site pages.
  * Please use the #ResBaz hashtag whenever tweeting about your event
  * If you need a copy of the ResBaz logo for advertising purposes, you can find it (in many different file formats) at [this folder](https://github.com/resbaz/resbaz-2016-02-01/tree/gh-pages/img/resbaz_logos) of the GitHub repository 




If you have any questions about running your ResBaz event, the best place go is the ResBaz [Gitter channel](http://melbourne.resbaz.edu.au/post/113825220654/join-us-on-gitter). Alternatively, you can tweet us [@ResBaz](https://twitter.com/ResBaz) or email research.bazaar@gmail.com.
