# Origins

The first ResBaz Conference was held at [The University of Melbourne in 2015](melbourne.resbaz.edu.au/resbaz2015). There were more than 150 attendees from 40 insititutions across both Australia & New Zealand. The purpose? Learn next generation digital research skills and do research better, faster, smarter. 

By 2016, ResBaz found an international stage. Alongside Melbourne, ResBaz had roots in Auckland, Perth, Dunedin, Brisbane, Sydney, Guayaquil, Vancouver, Oklahoma & Wellington!
