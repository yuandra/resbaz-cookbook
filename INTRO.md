# The Research Bazaar Cookbook

The aim of this Cookbook is to provide tips, tricks, advice & ingredients for starting a ResBaz Conference at your own institution. Like ResBaz, this Cookbook believes in open and collaborative communities. If you'd like to contribute and become an author of this cookbook, please email [research.bazaar@gmail.com](research.bazaar@gmail.com). Confused? Flick us an [email](research.bazaar@gmail.com) or tweet at [@ResBaz](www.twitter.com/resbaz).

Planning for ResBaz 2017 has already started! Dates have been set for January 31st - February 2 (3 days). Join the action on our collaborative Slack channel (ask for an invite via [email](research.bazaar@gmail.com)). We'll also be blogging our journey over on Wordpress - [see here for updates](resbaz.blog.wordpress.com). 

The Cookbook will end with two additional recipes: ResBaz Campaign & ResBaz Community. These will provide extra suggestions for continuing ResBaz into the year.
