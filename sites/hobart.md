[Data Science Hobart](https://datasciencehobart.github.io/) will host Tasmania's first ever ResBaz conference in early 2017. We're using this page to keep notes on the draft schedule.


### Classes

#### Streams 

When people register, they will be required to select one of the following streams. Each will run simultaneously over the first two days of the event.

| Class | Leader | Helpers | Teaching materials |
| :---  | :---   | :----   | :---              | 
| Software Carpentry with Python | Damien Irving | Pearse Buchanan | The Software Carpentry unix shell, Python and Git lessons (found [here](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html)) |
| Software Carpentry with R | Tom Remenyi | Mike Sumner, Bill Cohen  | The Software Carpentry unix shell, R and Git lessons (found [here](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html)) |

#### Electives

On the final day of the event (i.e. once the participants have got some core skills under their belt) a number of short elective classes will be offered. These will be 1.5-3.0 hours in length and participants won't have to sign up in advance - they can just whichever they like.

| Class | Leader     | Teaching materials |
| :---  | :---       | :----              | 
| Public speaking | Bill Cohen | |
| A tour of the scientific Python stack | Damien Irving | |

Other groups/people to approach about running an elective:
* IMOS
* [Hobart Hackerspace](https://hobarthackerspace.org.au/)


### Social events

| Event | Leader     | Description |
| :---  | :---       | :----       |

* Morning breakfast and yoga


### Speakers

| Topic             | Speaker/s      | Notes |
| :--               | :----          | :--   |
| Key-story (day 1) | Damien Irving  | Will include a brief history of ResBaz |
| Key-story (day 2) | ???            | |
| Key-story (day 3) | ???            | |

Key-stories replace the traditional "keynote" speaker. The idea is to find speakers who have had an atypical journey in their career (and to get them to talk about that interesting journey), as many early career researchers feel there's a right and wrong way to go about things, which isn't really true.
