[Data Science Hobart](https://datasciencehobart.github.io/) will host Tasmania's first ever ResBaz conference in early 2017. We're using this page to keep notes on the draft schedule.


### Classes

#### Streams (Day 1 and 2)

When people register, they will be required to select one of the following streams. Each will run simultaneously over the first two days of the event.

| Class | Leader | Helpers | Teaching materials |
| :---  | :---   | :----   | :---              | 
| Software Carpentry with Python | Damien Irving | Pearse Buchanan | The Software Carpentry unix shell, Python and Git lessons (found [here](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html)) |
| Software Carpentry with R | Tom Remenyi | Mike Sumner, Bill Cohen  | The Software Carpentry unix shell, R and Git lessons (found [here](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html)) |

#### Electives (Day 3)

On the final day of the event (i.e. once the participants have got some core skills under their belt) a number of short elective classes will be offered. These will be 0.5-3.0 hours in length and participants can attend whichever they like. During the lunch break exhibitors will have display tables so they can chat to attendees (and sign people up to their mailing lists, etc).

| Elective class | Leader | Type (approximate length) |
| :---  | :---       | :----              | 
| Public speaking | Bill Cohen | Workshop (3 hours) |
| A tour of the scientific Python stack | Damien Irving | Talk/demonstration (30 minutes) |
| How to write a reproducible paper | Damien Irving | Talk (30 minutes) |
| Dumb question session | Software Carpentry instructors | Question and answer session (1.5 hours) |

| Exhibitor               | Contact person  |
| :---                    | :---            |
| Data Science Hobart     | Mike Sumner     |
| IMAS Python Users Group | Pearse Buchanan |
| Hobart R Users Group    | Bill Cohen      |
| [UTAS bioinformatics](https://lists.utas.edu.au/mailman/listinfo/bioinformatics-list)     | Michael Charleston |

### Speakers

| Topic             | Speaker/s      | Notes |
| :--               | :----          | :--   |
| Keystory (day 1)  | Damien Irving  | Will include a brief history of ResBaz |
| Keystory (day 2)  | ???            | |
| Keystory (day 3)  | ???            | |

Key-stories replace the traditional "keynote" speaker. The idea is to find speakers who have had an atypical journey in their career (and to get them to talk about that interesting journey), as many early career researchers feel there's a right and wrong way to go about things, which isn't really true.   


### Draft schedule

Days 1 and 2 are effectively a couple of Software Carpentry workshops running simultaneously. Day 3 is then the "bazaar", with elective classes on all sorts of different digital research tools and techniques. We could offer tickets to all three days or just the final day.
